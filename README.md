# Text analysis
Currently just a single script for supervised text classification. This grabs tickets off our Trello boards, pulls out the text and uses Spacy and Scikit Learn to try to predict labels. 

You'll need to give the location of your own Trello keys. Otherwise running it should be pretty straightforward.
